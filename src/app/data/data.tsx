What started as a curiosity through an online JavaScript course quickly turned into a deep passionâ€”JavaScript had me at hello, literally ðŸ™‚. Since then, Iâ€™ve been constantly learning and evolving. Iâ€™ve completed several formal training programs, including an intensive full-stack development bootcamp at the School of Applied Technology (</SALT>) in Stockholm and a 12-month frontend development academy at Brainster in Skopje.",
  body1:
    "Along the way, Iâ€™ve built real-world projects, collaborated in agile teams, and strengthened both my frontend and full-stack skills. Most recently, I worked as a frontend developer at Revam in MalmÃ¶, where I contributed to building a new AI-driven platform using Next.js, focusing on clean design and intuitive user experience. Iâ€™m actively looking for full-time or part-time opportunities and am available to begin work immediately. I believe the best way to grow is through hands-on experience, and Iâ€™m always eager to take on new challenges, build meaningful projects, and collaborate with others."
